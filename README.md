# Machine-learning-H-bond-strength

This repository contains code for building a machine learning algorithm that maps the information of hydrogen bond donor-acceptor along with the experimental vibrational frequency shift to the hydrogen bond strength.

Refer to the Jupyter note book [Machine Learning of Hydrogen Bond Strength](https://github.com/Lei-Lei-alpha/Machine-learning-H-bond-strength/blob/main/ml_hbond/hbondml.ipynb) for details.
